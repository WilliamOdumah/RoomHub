### Vision Statement
To transform shared living by simplifying household organization and helping people find the perfect roommates.

### Key Objectives:

* **Efficient Organization:** Streamlines expense tracking and chore management, reducing the complexity of shared living arrangements.
* **Informed Decisions:** The app enables users to find roommates who match their living style based on honest feedback from previous roommates.
* **Convenience:** Automated reminders and notifications keep users on top of payments and tasks, fostering a more organized and stress-free living environment.


### Core Features

* **Shared Expenses Calculator:**
Users can add and track expenses such as rent, groceries, and insurance, with a clear view of how much each person owes.

* **Tasks Organizer:**
Roommates can assign and manage household chores, ensuring that responsibilities are clearly defined and everyone knows their tasks.

* **Reminders and Notifications:**
The app sends alerts for upcoming payments and pending tasks, helping users stay organized and on track.

* **Rate Your Roommate:**
Users can rate and provide detailed feedback about their roommates, offering valuable insights that help future users make informed decisions.

### Technology Stack

* #### Front End:
  * **React.js:**
  A robust library for building interactive and dynamic web interfaces, ensuring a responsive and engaging user experience. React.js will be utilized for the web version of the Roomies app.

  * **Flutter:**
  A cross-platform framework for creating high-performance applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase, ensuring a consistent look and feel across different devices. Flutter will be used for the mobile and desktop applications.

* #### Back End:

  * **Express:**
  A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that is ideal for handling HTTP requests and server-side logic efficiently, making it a suitable choice for API development.

  * **Database:**
    **Amazon RDS:**
    A managed relational database service that supports MySQL, offering automated backups, scaling, and high availability. This will serve as the primary database for the app, ensuring robust data management and reliability.
